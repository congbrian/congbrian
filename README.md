## Hello, Brian here ðŸ‘‹
I'm currently working at Liberty Robotics on fine tuning segmentation models; I'm also working on an AI detector algorithm in my spare time! 
I'm currently in the final year of my Bachelor's degree in computer science, and looking to begin my Master's degree once I finish!
